# Changelog

## Unreleased — v0.4.1 Deep Reading Pipeline

- Reclassified the previous ResNet, LOVECLIM and U-Net outputs as failed deep-reading examples rather than accepted blind notes.
- Added the canonical slot-driven `Paper Template - Final` asset for all `deep` and `internalize` notes.
- Expanded ClaimRecord types and added structured titles, explanatory details, conditions, section IDs and importance.
- Added deterministic deep-reading gates for required content groups, content recall, section depth and Final-template conformance.
- Kept `skim` output separate from the Final deep-reading template.
- Added regression tests proving that a sparse one-claim ledger is blocked and a rich ledger renders the complete Final template.
- Reprepared and rebuilt ResNet, LOVECLIM and climate U-Net as real-paper forward-validation cases; all three now pass Final-template, multi-page traceability, content-recall, section-depth, quote-completeness, numeric-rendering, cross-section consistency and paper-type gates.
- Fixed duplicated numeric suffixes, rejected incomplete evidence quotations, mapped data/metrics/experiments into the correct Final-template sections and required an all-figure inventory with both method and result coverage where available.
- Added result visuals for the three repaired examples: ResNet Figure 6, LOVECLIM Figure 21 and U-Net Figure 7.
- Kept the candidate unreleased because the local runtime still requires the specialised reading passes to populate the ledgers.
- Automatic multi-pass full-text deep reading, automatic PyMuPDF–MinerU fusion and independent semantic review are explicitly deferred to v0.5.
